# fairytale a simple audiobook player for my baby girl

Fairytale is an audiobook player - obviosly I had fairy tales in my mind, but the project can be used for any kind of audiobook.
 
It is heavily inspired by the amazing audiobook player by Willem van der Jagt but I created my own case, and also added some other stuff.
