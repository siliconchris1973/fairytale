# fairytale
## Introduction
Fairytale is an Arduino powered mp3-player designed to play audiobooks and controlled via NFC tags. 
The tags could for example be attached to little figures - such as Snowhite.

Fairytale operates from an Arduino UNO V3 onto which an Adafruit Music Maker Shield is attached.
Furthermore there is a Sunfounder PN532 NFC breakout board attached to it and finally a potentiometer
for volume control and 4 buttons for pause/unpause, next previous and ligght effects on and off.
Oh, yes and then there is an RGB LED for light effects :-)

In the directory arduino-codeline one may find the current state of the Arduino code.


I started this project off on a Raspberry PI but gave up on it. If you'd like to give it a try, you can 
find the latest state of work in the sub directory RASPI-stuff - be aware though that I never finished it!
