A simple node.js script to play mp3 audiobooks (or any mp3 file for that
matter) selected by reading in an rfid tag from an rfid tag.

To get going issue:

  npm install

If you happen to be doing this on OS X you _may_ need to accept the developers
license for Xcode. Agree to the license terms by executing (in a shell, of
course):

  sudo xcodebuild -license



To start up the player execute:

  node app.js
